# Inventory
Inventory System for small business
This inventory system was built using Java and JavaFX.
As it was for a class earlier in my degree, its focus was on using JavaFX for the user interface, ensuring adequate exception handling, and generally providing experience writing a program with multiple screens/classes/etc. It uses the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern.
